\chapter{Testing}
Testing is an important part of any application's development cycle. By testing we want to show that the client is able to process valid UIP documents. In order to do so, we created a testing application which will cover the following scenarios:\\


\begin{itemize}
  \item Interface inclusion
  This test evaluates whether including one interface into other functions.
  \item Model-wide binding
  In our testing application we bound several properties to models. The binding was tested with: text color, text size, position of UI control (interpolation), integer value
  \item Events
\end{itemize}

Testing was primarily done by directly running the developed solution on the provided windows phone device (HTC 8S). Visual Studio offers means for running and debugging the application which allow for fast development. 
We developed a testing app written in UIP XML language which was then run by the developed client. This application covered the testing of switching interfaces, including them, models and their updates, animations and events.

To widen the coverage of testing we also added unit tests which should detect bugs that were not discovered while running the testing application. The unit tests cover the most important classes of the project.
