\section{UI Protocol}
Universal Interface Protocol (UIP) is a user interface specification language developed at CTU for research purposes. At the time of writing this thesis, its specification is not publicly available. UIP provides means for describing user interfaces and transferring data related to interaction between user and an UIP based application. UIP is designed to be cross-platform and  programming language independent.\\
UIP is XML based language that allows describing the hierarchical structure of an user interface, the placement of the components and their appearance.\\
UIP is designed as a client-server system.
