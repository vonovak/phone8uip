    Call someone from your contact list & "Call contact name" 
           (where contact name is the name of someone in your contact list) 
           If the person has only one phone number in your contact card, the call will start. If he or she has multiple phone numbers, you'll see an option to choose one. \\ \hline
    Call any phone number & "Call phone number" (where phone number is any phone number, whether it belongs to a contact or not)\\ \hline
     Redial the last number & "Redial" \\ \hline
    Send a text message & "Text contact name" (where contact name is the name of someone in your contact list). This will start a text message to that person. Then you can dictate and send the messageâ€”hands-free. \\ \hline
    Call your voicemail & "Call voicemail" \\ \hline
    Open an application & "Open application" or "Start application" (where application is the name of any application on your phone, such as "Calendar," "Maps," or "Music") \\ \hline
    Search the web & "Find search term" or "Search for search term" (where search term is what you're looking for). If you say "Find local pizza," for example, Bing will bring up a map of nearby pizza places. \\ \end{tabularx}
