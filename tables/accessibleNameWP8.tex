    \textbf{Element type} & \textbf{Description} \\
    Static text UI elements & For \texttt{TextBlock} and \texttt{RichTextBlock} elements, an accessible name is automatically determined from the visible (inner) text. All of the text in that element is used as the name. \\ \hline
    Images & The XAML \texttt{Image} element does not have a direct analog to the HTML \texttt{alt} attribute of \texttt{img} and similar elements. WP8 does not provide an alternative text. WP8.1 provides \texttt{AutomationProperties.Name} \\ \hline
    Buttons and links & The accessible name of a button or link is based on the visible text, using the same rules as described in the first row of the table. In cases where a button contains only an image, WP8 does not provide an alternative text. WP8.1 provides \texttt{AutomationProperties.Name} \\
